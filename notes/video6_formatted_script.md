# Video Script: Introduction to TypeScript

**Video Title:** Introduction to TypeScript

**Video Duration:** ~10-12 minutes

---

**[SCENE 1: Introduction]**

*   **[Visuals]:**
    *   Start with a JavaScript code snippet that has a subtle bug (e.g., a typo in a property name).
    *   An animation shows the code running and then crashing at runtime.
    *   The scene rewinds, and the code is transformed into TypeScript. A red squiggly line appears under the typo *before* the code is run.
    *   Title card: "Introduction to TypeScript: Supercharging Your JavaScript"
*   **[Narration]:**
    "Welcome to Phase 2 of our series: 'Mastering AI-Assisted Development.' To effectively guide AI and build robust applications, we need to use tools that help us catch errors early. This is where **TypeScript** comes in."

    "Have you ever had a bug in your JavaScript that you only found when you ran the code? TypeScript is designed to prevent that. It's a 'superset' of JavaScript, which means it's just JavaScript with an added feature: a static type system. Let's explore what that means."

**[SCENE 2: The Problem TypeScript Solves]**

*   **[Visuals]:**
    *   Show a simple JavaScript function on screen.
    *   Show different, incorrect ways the function is called, leading to `undefined` or `NaN` (Not a Number) results.
*   **[Narration]:**
    "Let's look at this simple JavaScript function. It's supposed to take an object with a `price` and `quantity` and return the total. But what happens if we accidentally pass a string? Or an object with the wrong property name? JavaScript will happily try to run this, and we'll get unexpected results or runtime errors."

    **[Code Snippet - Display]:**
    ```javascript
    function calculateTotal(item) {
      return item.price * item.quantity;
    }

    calculateTotal({ price: 10, quantity: 2 }); // ✅ 20
    calculateTotal({ cost: 10, amount: 2 });   // ❌ NaN
    ```
    **[Narration]:**
    "We get no warning about this until we run the code. TypeScript solves this by letting us describe the 'shape' of our data."

---

**[SCENE 3: Core Concepts: Types and Interfaces]**

*   **[Visuals]:**
    *   The JavaScript code from the previous scene is converted to TypeScript.
    *   An `interface` is defined.
    *   Type annotations are added to the function parameters.
    *   The incorrect function call now has a red squiggly line under it in the editor, with a tooltip showing the type error.
*   **[Narration]:**
    "With TypeScript, we can define an `interface`, which is like a contract for the shape of an object. Here, we're saying that an `Item` *must* have a `price` property that's a number and a `quantity` property that's a number."

    **[Code Snippet - Type/Display]:**
    ```typescript
    interface Item {
      price: number;
      quantity: number;
    }

    function calculateTotal(item: Item): number {
      return item.price * item.quantity;
    }
    ```
    **[Narration]:**
    "We then annotate our function, saying it accepts one argument, `item`, which must be of type `Item`, and that the function will return a `number`."

    "Now, look what happens when we try to call it with the wrong data. We get an error right in our editor, before we even save the file. This is the power of static typing. It catches bugs before they happen."

**[SCENE 4: The Compilation Step]**

*   **[Visuals]:**
    *   A diagram shows the development workflow:
        *   1. Developer writes code in `app.ts`.
        *   2. Runs the `tsc` command in the terminal.
        *   3. The TypeScript compiler checks for errors.
        *   4. A new, browser-readable `app.js` file is generated in a `dist` folder.
    *   Show the `tsconfig.json` file, briefly highlighting `rootDir` and `outDir`.
*   **[Narration]:**
    "An important thing to understand is that browsers don't run TypeScript directly. We need a **compilation step**. We use the TypeScript compiler, `tsc`, to convert our `.ts` files into standard `.js` files that any browser can understand."

    "We configure the compiler with a `tsconfig.json` file. This file tells TypeScript where our source code is (the `rootDir`) and where to put the compiled JavaScript output (the `outDir`)."

    "In our project, we've set up a build script in `package.json`. So all we have to do is run `npm run build`, and TypeScript handles the rest. Our HTML file then references the compiled JavaScript file from the `dist` folder."

**[SCENE 5: Conclusion]**

*   **[Visuals]:**
    *   A summary graphic showing the key benefits of TypeScript: "Catch errors early," "Better autocompletion," "Safer refactoring."
    *   Show a title card for the next video: "Integrating AI into Your Workflow".
*   **[Narration]:**
    "Using TypeScript makes our code more robust, easier to maintain, and easier to reason about, especially in large projects. It provides a safety net that lets us build with more confidence."

    "Now that we have this type-safe foundation, we're ready to explore how to leverage AI assistants even more effectively. In our next video, we'll look at practical ways to integrate AI directly into our development workflow for tasks like writing tests and refactoring code."

    "Thanks for watching. Try converting some of your JavaScript projects to TypeScript and experience the benefits for yourself!"
